# Add this file to your project at .github/workflows/edgio.yml
#
# This GitHub action deploys your site on edgio.
#
# The site is deployed each time commits are pushed. The environment to which the changes are deployed
# is based on the following rules:
#
# 1.) When pushing to master, changes deployed to the "staging" environment. This environment does not exist
#     by default. You must create it using https://app.edgio.co.
# 2.) When pushing to any other branch, changes are deployed to the default environment. A unique URL is created based on the branch and deployment number.
# 3.) When you publish a release in GitHub, the associated tag will be deployed to the production
#     environment. This environment does not exist by default, you must create it using https://app.edgio.co.
#     Therefore, you can push to production by creating a GitHub release, or by using the "Promote to Environment"
#     menu when viewing a deployment in https://app.edgio.co.
#
# In order for this action to deploy your site, you must create a deploy token from the site settings page
# in https://app.edgio.co and configure it as a secret called "edgio_deploy_token" in your repo on GitHub.
